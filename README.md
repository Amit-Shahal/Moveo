# Moveo
## My home task for Moveo.

A 9 pad loop machine that its main functionality is
when a pad is turned on, it should start playing its loop on the
next loop cycle, not immediately (all playing loops should be
synced - starting together at the same point). Also, repeat the
loop as long as the pad is on. (make sure to avoid any delay in
order to be synched)
